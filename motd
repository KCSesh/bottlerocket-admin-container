Welcome to Thar's Handy Administrator Resources (the admin container)!

This container provides access to the Thar host filesystems and contains
common tools for inspection and troubleshooting.  It is based on
Amazon Linux 2, and most things are in the same places you would find them
on an AL2 host.

To permit more intrusive troubleshooting, including actions that mutate the
running state of the Thar host, we provide a tool called "sheltie" (`sudo sheltie`).
When run, this tool drops you into a root shell on the Thar host.
