Welcome to Thar's Handy Administrator Resources (the admin container)!

This container provides access to the Thar host filesystems and contains
common tools for inspection and troubleshooting.  It is based on
Amazon Linux 2, and most things are in the same places you would find them
on an AL2 host.

In the future, you will be able to use the break-glass tool to set up a
writable overlay of Thar's filesystems, to permit more intrusive
troubleshooting, including actions that mutate the running state of the
Thar host.  The overlay will not be persisted, changes made there will
be lost if the Thar host is rebooted.
